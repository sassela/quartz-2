A digital garden is a personal collection of notes that are pruned and cultivated over time.

I like the idea of a digital garden as it lowers the barrier to [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) and sharing ideas with others. I'm interested in modelling my notes as a graph in order to eventually identify patterns between potentially disparate topics.

For the last few years I've used the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) writing app and the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) note-taking method to learn and connect ideas. This digital garden is a public subset of my notes that I think could be helpful or interesting to others. I use the [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) static site generator to publish my notes to this website.

I'm inspired by the following writers, makers and thinkers:
- [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/author/annelaure)
- [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)
- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)
