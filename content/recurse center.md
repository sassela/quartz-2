## hello, recurse center!

A little list of things I'm thinking about or working on at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) between September-December 2023 (Fall 2, 2023 batch).

## projects

Things I'd like to make for the sake of it.

- A [[digital garden]]. You are here.
- A plant and garden-care app that will help me to keep my plants alive.
- Amazon subscribe-and-save for small online shops.
- Something that will help me to practice detecting and fixing memory leaks.
- "So, you're a new parent?" online community noticeboard with nice things for new families to do.
- A habit-building helper.

## technologies

Things I'd like to learn. If I follow a course or book, I plan to create or contribute to a [free, open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) project to prove to myself I've understood what I'm doing.

- [[learning javascript|TypeScript]]
- [Something lispy](https://github.com/sassela/beautiful-racket)
- LLMs
- Rust
- Idris
- Mobile apps
