## why?

- learned at uni
- wanted something cute after [[learning javascript|my last project]]

## til

- language oriented programming
- source to source compiler / transpiler made of:
	- [[reader]]: source code -> s-expressions
		- every reader must export a `read-syntax` function: describing a module
	- [[expander]]: s-expressions -> racket
	- s-expression is the intermediate representation
- in racket, everything is true `#t`, including `0` and `null` except `#f`
- `quote` or `'` turns expression into a `datum`
- `datum` syntax object (so we can treat code as data)
- macros: `datum`-> `datum`. a.k.a syntax transformers
- [[reader]] responsible for code form
- [[expander]] responsible for code meaning
- every expander must export `#%module-begin`
- [[pattern variable]] matches each line of code passed to a macro
	- e.g. `(define-macro (macro-name HANDLE-EXPR ...) ...)`
- `unquote` or `#'` turns code into a syntax object
