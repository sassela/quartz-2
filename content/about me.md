Hello, I'm Abby. I'm a full-stack Senior Software Engineer. My deepest experience is with functional programming languages including Haskell, PureScript and Clojure/Script. However, I'm a generalist and polyglot, and use the most appropriate tool to solve the problem at hand.

In my spare time, I love to teach, mentor and share the joy of programming with others. I support initiatives that improve digital equity and access to opportunities in technology, like Code Club, Code First Girls and Coding Black Females.

## my work

2021: I worked as a Senior Haskell Engineer and Tech Lead on an open-source GraphQL engine. My favourite achievement was to design and replace a test suite that couldn't evolve with product testing needs. The new suite runs up to 10x faster, is easier to maintain, and supports new testing capabilities for the entire dev team.

Technologies: Haskell, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Python, Docker.

2018: I developed a free college admissions guidance platform towards product-market fit. My favourite achievements all involve working closely with users to solve their problems. For example, debugging a memory leak that impacted hundreds of users, or leading an internal project to improve the user experience and key product metrics.

Technologies: Haskell, PureScript, Ruby-on-Rails, PostgreSQL, AWS.

2015: I worked with a few startups and a large commercial bank. My favourite achievement was to build a greenfield luxury e-commerce product, on time and to requirements, for hundreds of thousands of users. Also, to halve app-wide page load time by replacing the ClojureScript framework wholesale.

Technologies: Clojure/Script, Haskell, PureScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
