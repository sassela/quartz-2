# [[number conversion in haskell]]
- Why doesn't Haskell just **coerce** the inputs?
    * Automatic conversion?
    * Design decision: [https://wiki.haskell.org/Generic_number_type](https://wiki.haskell.org/Generic_number_type)
* Advantages / Idioms
    * function example
    * inputs as general as possible for use case
    * explicitly define types
    * retain integrity (avoid lossy casting)
    * Other number problems
    * Applicative
    * Many numbers: functors?
* Other types to explore
    * [Word](https://ro-che.info/articles/2017-06-05-word-vs-int)
    * Natural
    * Int16/32, Word32
    * RealFrac?
        * Rational
        * Double
    * Fractional
