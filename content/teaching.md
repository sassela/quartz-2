Here are some resources I've created or adapted in the past to teach programming.
## [code club](https://codeclub.org/en/)
[Code Club](https://codeclub.org/en/) is a global network of free code clubs and resources to teach programming to 9-13 year olds. [Here's a coding project series](https://lirio-atsit-emvur-landi.notion.site/Code-Club-CodeWorld-bbec28f4f28a4997894dd4f23c29754f) I adapted to teach CodeWorld, an educational variant of Haskell.

## introduction to haskell
[Here's a project-led workshop](https://lirio-atsit-emvur-landi.notion.site/Haskell-Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors-3db74cf60e2640b391eb4e6d3cd09964?pvs=4) I created to teach introductory Haskell to a group of adults. The completed project is a rock, paper, scissors game.
