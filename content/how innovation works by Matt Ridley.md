## Book Review: How Innovation Works by Matt Ridley

_How Innovation Works_ is a book that only briefly touches on how innovation works. More than half of the text was dedicated to _examples_ of innovation; in everything from agriculture to communication to public healthcare.

Also, Iâ€™m not certain whether this book is about innovation (how is innovation defined?) or creative ideas. Maybe thatâ€™s impacted my interpretation of the book.

Hereâ€™s what I did take from _How Innovation Works_:

### Innovation isnâ€™t innovative.

Creative ideas are rarely (truly) unique, but rather a combination of ideas and the current state of the world at that time. Anne-Laure Le Cunff writes about this in her post on [Combinational Creativity](https://nesslabs.com/combinational-creativity) post.

> It is striking that the boomerang, the blowpipe and the pyramid were all invented independently on different continents â€“ as was agriculture.

The book gives several examples of innovations that were developed at roughly the same time in disparate areas.

> In 1922 William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas at Columbia University produced a list of 148 cases of near-simultaneous invention by more than one person, including photography, the telescope and typewriters.

### Innovation is different from invention

Several examples in the book are a product of collaboration between groups across a period of time. So, why do we focus on promoting innovation as a single breakthrough by one person?

> If innovation is a gradual, evolutionary process, why is it so often described in terms of revolutions, heroic breakthroughs and sudden enlightenment? Two answers: human nature and the intellectual property system

The short answer, according to the author is Western human nature. Western culture loves a lone genius, promoting individualism because we value it so much more than collaboration. The lone genius makes for a better story and a better career for that individual.

### Innovation is usually the result of unlimited funds

Many of the examples in the book were funded by military/public funding; the World Wide Web, the computer, antibiotics. The book Bit Tyrants by Rob Larson also discusses this phenomenon, and the pattern of private profit originating from publicly-funded innovation.

### Innovation is stifled by slow-moving monoliths

The author acknowledged that many innovative ideas originated from the public sector. At the same time, he criticised the pace of innovation by (often public) monoliths: educational institutions, government etc.

For example, the author anticipated the innovative potential of video conferencing in Britain, which seemed to have the ideal conditions: 

1. The UK requires high-speed broadband in order to communicate with other countries. 
2. High-speed broadband would be of disproportionate benefit to traffic congested, English-speaking UK. 
3. There was a potential for network effects and vendor/infrastructure lock-in.

However, the author lamented the fact that Britain was slow to take advantage of this opportunity. Again, this could be a contributor to the public funding â†’ private profit phenomenon.

### Innovation is a function of experimentation

> Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week. Being wrong might hurt you a bit, but being slow will kill you

Lots of parallels to draw from other books such as Sprint, Inspired and The Lean Startup. The author posits that the more experiments you run, the more ideas you can test, and the more likely you are to find a successful idea.

### Innovation in overestimated in the short term, underestimated in the long term

The author used Blockchain, AI and other examples, referencing Amaraâ€™s hype cycle and estimated that the hype only correlated with its actual potential after about 15 years of the original introduction.

> something new that increases the specialization of production or increases the diversity of consumption will catch on, something that returns us towards self-sufficiency will not catch on.

### Overall impression

In my opinion, this book didnâ€™t live up to its name or premise, presenting examples of innovation followed by shallow analysis, rather than "how it works".

### Further research/reading

* Book: The Innovation Illusion
    
    > Fredrik Erixon and BjÃ¶rn Weigel, in their book [â€¦], argue that the existential challenge of todayâ€™s capitalism is to break the habit of both companiesâ€™ and governmentsâ€™ reluctance to encourage innovation, despite their words.
