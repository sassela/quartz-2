* improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck is an illusion
* steps:  ^ddd6d0
    * identify the constraint: by outlining the measuring the system
    * exploit the constraint: use it to full capacity
    * subordinate the constraint
        * drum-buffer-rope: make all other work match max throughput of constraint
    * elevate the constraint
* example: brent is the bottleneck in the book The Phoenix Project %% [[2021-11-14-book-the-phoenix-project]] %%. 
	* in practice, three lists were made
		* work that needs brent
			* exploit: document or automate the fuck out of it so it doesn't need brent next time
		* work that increases brent's throughput
			* prioritise
		* everything else
			* reduce or delegate
